At the same time, the growing world of social networking online makes it relatively easy for anyone to get involved and share their weather observations. 
The Met Office is helping to co-ordinate the growth of the weather observing community in the UK, by asking anyone to submit the observations they are taking. 
This can be done using all levels of equipment, so there are no cost restrictions.

What is the current weather at the moment? 
How much rainfall is there today in my hometown? Was there frost the night? 
What was the maximum temperature today in my hometown? Just a few questions about the weather that are asked every day in nearly every household. 
Chances are that you also have those questions. Hetweeractueel.nl answers all these questions. 
Besides the <a href="http://www.hetweeractueel.nl/" target="_blank">weatherconditions</a> of all cooperating weather stations, you will also find a comprehensive weather forecast. 
The data also lends itself to a <a href="http://www.hetweeractueel.nl/actueel-temperatuur-kaartje" target="_blank">current temperature</a> map.

(= automatic weather map system) and is, as the name suggests, a system which produces overview maps from the weather data provided by participating private weather stations.
<br /> 
The data is made available to AWEKAS by the weather station operators who upload a small text or CSV file to their own website. 
AWEKAS then collects this data automatically, and processes it to provide up to date maps.
<br /> 
AWEKAS works automatically and provides every second current maps about temperature, wind, precipitation, barometric pressure, 
and maps with current weather conditions and weather warnings.
<br />
If you want to participate to the AWEKAS project, it is obviously entirely free.

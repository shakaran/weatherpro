==Introduction==

The previous app is used for a lot weather stations but it is a messy app, without dabatase configuration and no object oriented code.

I am rewriting this application for improve the quality of code under AGPLv3 LICENSE. 

I am a freelancer, you can hire me for custom modifications or improvements via my Upwork profile.

Donations are welcome (you can sent via Paypal to my gmail address in my GitHub profile) but only if you want back me or proud of my work, 
but I prefer real paid work since I am a professional, no requesting for code charity.
